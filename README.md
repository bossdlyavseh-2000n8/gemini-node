## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, chatbots and AI tools play a crucial role in enhancing user experience and automating tasks. The **Gemini Node** project aims to leverage the capabilities of the Google Gemini API to create robust chatbots that can engage users in meaningful conversations and provide automated solutions. 

With the rise of generative AI, we can now build applications that understand context, respond intelligently, and learn from interactions. This repository serves as a foundation for developers to explore these possibilities.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly connect to the Google Gemini API.
- **Chatbot Framework**: Build chatbots with natural language understanding.
- **Generative AI Tools**: Create applications that generate responses based on user input.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Utilize the power of Node.js for backend development.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Access detailed guides and examples.

## Installation

To get started with **Gemini Node**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SquidyMp/gemini-node.git
   cd gemini-node
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**:

   You will need to set up your Google Gemini API credentials. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured your API key, you can start building your chatbot or AI tool. 

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and you can begin interacting with your chatbot or tool.

## API Integration

Integrating the Google Gemini API is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to make API calls.

### Making API Requests

You can use the `axios` library to make requests to the Gemini API. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getResponse(userInput) {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.gemini.com/v1/chat', {
        prompt: userInput,
        apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
    });
    return response.data;
}
```

### Handling Responses

Make sure to handle the responses appropriately to provide meaningful interactions in your chatbot.

## Creating a Chatbot

Building a chatbot involves several steps, including setting up intents, handling user input, and generating responses.

### Step 1: Define Intents

Create a structure for your chatbot's intents. For example:

```javascript
const intents = {
    greeting: ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"],
    farewell: ["Goodbye", "See you later"],
};
```

### Step 2: User Input Handling

Capture user input and determine the appropriate intent. You can use simple string matching or more advanced NLP techniques.

### Step 3: Generate Responses

Use the Gemini API to generate responses based on user input and defined intents.

## Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started:

### Example 1: Basic Chatbot

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
    const userInput = req.body.message;
    const response = await getResponse(userInput);
    res.json(response);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Chatbot server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Example 2: Advanced Chatbot with Context

You can enhance your chatbot by maintaining context across interactions. Store user sessions and manage state effectively.
